Page 1: Preface & Introduction
General Notes: Generally, Astrology is based on three major divisions.
1.	The first part involves calculating the positions of planets and creating various notes based on mathematics. This section is primarily used by those who calculate the Panchangam (Almanac).
2.	Using the information obtained from this to write a horoscope based on date of birth, time, and place is another division. However, this is not as difficult as calculating the Panchangam.
3.	Writing the horoscope based on the notes in the Panchangam constitutes "Horoscope Mathematics." Regardless, in modern times, even astrologers provide horoscopes written with the help of computers.

This book does not contain notes on how to write (calculate) a horoscope. This book focuses on predicting results. Therefore, since many free software options are now available online, use one of them. Regardless of whose horoscope is given to you, generate the chart using your preferred software and use the notes in this book to predict the results.
Note: To learn about calculating planetary positions, understanding the Panchangam, or learning how to calculate planetary positions for several hundred years ago, or for training and books regarding scientific and mathematical explanations of astrology, please contact: Astrologer & Almanac Mathematician, Mr. R. Arulvel. Address: Anmigan Jothida Kuzhumam, Chettiar Street, Ayyampalayam - 624204, (Near Athur), Dindigul District. Mobile: 9842841497.
To predict results fundamentally, one requires a strong understanding of Planetary names, Rasi (Sign) names, and Planetary Karakas (Significations). It is also necessary to know certain other details.
I do not agree with giving bundles of rules and asking you to memorize them. Until now, as soon as we say "Astrology," we talk about Rasi Palan (predictions based on Moon sign). Moving past that, we talk about Lagana Palan (predictions based on Ascendant).
Although we speak generally about birth month predictions or daily predictions, Formal Astrology involves the 12 Bhavas (Houses):
1.	Tanur Bhava (Body)
2.	Dhana Bhava (Wealth)
3.	Sahodara Bhava (Siblings)
4.	Mathru Bhava (Mother)
5.	Puthira Bhava (Children)
6.	Sathru Bhava (Enemy)
7.	Kalathira Bhava (Spouse)
8.	Ayul Bhava (Longevity)
9.	Pithru Bhava (Father)
10.	Jeevana Bhava (Career/Livelihood)
11.	Labha Bhava (Profit)
12.	Viraya Bhava (Loss/Expense)
We usually analyze the Lords of these houses, the house where the Lord is seated, the stars (Saram) obtained by that Lord, and the lordship of that Star Lord.
We also look at the strength of the house where he sat, the natural qualities of the planets, the houses they aspect, Friend/Enemy/Neutral status, Shunya, Thiyajyam, Amsham, Drishti Yoga, Varga strength, Dasa (Major Period), Bukthi (Sub-period), Antharam, and Sukshumam. Predictions are usually given based on various complex calculations.
However, our method is designed to bring you out of such complex understandings and allow you to predict results using very minimized rules.
Do not be confused that fewer rules might mean inaccurate results. In previous methods, errors might occur in understanding and calculating because the rules are vast. You might have predicted based on the few rules you knew, but unknowingly, you might have forgotten or been unaware of auxiliary rules. Therefore, more rules are often the main cause of more errors.
In our Rajanadi method, since we state the fundamental concepts without making you memorize rules, you can formulate the rules in your own subconscious mind. Therefore, there is no chance for errors.
The field of Astrology predicts a person's life based on three things: Planets, Rasis (Signs), and Bhavas (Houses). Rasi has a static character; planets and Bhavas have a changing nature for everyone. Therefore, we understand one through the other.
Page 3: Core Methodology
We understand:
•	Bhava strength through Planets.
•	Planetary strength through other Planets.
•	Bhava strength through Bhavas.
•	Planetary strength through Bhavas.
•	Planetary and Bhava strength through Rasis.
Predictions are given on this basis. Among these, the rule "Understanding Planetary and Bhava strength through Rasis" is the only common rule. Other astrological systems pick one of the other rules and build their system around it. Mostly, there are no rules beyond these fundamentals.
We are also going to take some fundamentals from this and predict results.
1.	Understanding a planet's strength through another planet.
2.	Understanding a planet's strength through Rasis.
We can give satisfactory predictions using just these two rules.
Generally, the basis of all astrological systems is centered on the Kalapurusha Tattva (Time Personified). According to this, Aries (Mesham) is the first house (Lagana) and indicates the character of the "Self". Gradually, the subsequent houses indicate the subsequent Bhavas and their natures.
In Traditional Astrology, since Aries (the first house of Kalapurusha) holds the qualities of the Lagana, we understand that regardless of whose horoscope it is, the Lagana holds the qualities of the first house of the Kalapurusha.
But we understand that the qualities of Aries (the first house of Kalapurusha) are enacted by its Lord, Mars (Sevvai). All are one and the same. Because the Kalapurusha philosophy is structured such that the qualities of a House and the qualities of that House Lord align.
•	Lagana: Appearance, Body, Physique — Mars
•	2nd Bhava: Wealth, Family, Speech proficiency — Venus
•	3rd Bhava: Contacts/Communication, Education — Mercury
•	4th Bhava: Mother, Mind, House, Vehicle — Moon
•	5th Bhava: Ancestry, Creation, Nuance — Sun
•	6th Bhava: Litigious thoughts, Bad contacts — Mercury
•	7th Bhava: Spouse, Society, Wealth — Venus
•	8th Bhava: Health, Trouble, Sudden actions — Mars
•	9th Bhava: Charity (Dharma), Purpose of birth — Jupiter
•	10th Bhava: Karma, Livelihood, Profession — Saturn
•	11th Bhava: Profits from profession — Saturn
•	12th Bhava: Purpose of the native, Success — Jupiter
We understand the same thing from different angles. But simply put: From now on, we don't need to search for a "Bhava." We can know the necessary qualities directly through the Planets.
Page 4: Planets as Significators
Therefore, in the horoscopes we analyze henceforth, we will learn the results based on the degrees of the planets in the houses. Instead of "Bhava" or "Lagana," we will predict directly using Planets.
Just as every Bhava provides specific results, every Planet helps us know specific results. They are:
1.	Sun: Native's Father, Son, Administrative Ability.
2.	Moon: Native's Mother, Mind.
3.	Mercury: Native's Education, Daughter, Listening ability, Speaking ability.
4.	Venus: Native's Female friends, Wife, Wealth.
5.	Mars: Native's Male friends, Husband, Health, Debt-free life.
6.	Jupiter: The Native, their character. The Native will hold a decision or experience about themselves within. Whether it is pride or disgust, their "Self"—which only they know—is Jupiter.
7.	Saturn: Native's Profession, Profit.
(Note: Though Rahu and Ketu have separate qualities, generally we do not use them here. The qualities listed above for the planets are for high-frequency usage. More planetary and Rasi qualities are given in the book.)
From now on, you do not need to find the "Bhava" to predict. We can see it directly with the help of the Planet.
Example: To see a native's profession or job, we can understand it based on where Saturn is seated. This is explained in the relevant section.
In our method, we determine the good and bad effects a primary planet delivers to the native based on:
•	The place the planet is seated.
•	The conjunction of planets.
•	The nature/quality of the planet.
Conjunction: "Conjunction" does not necessarily mean they must be in the same Rasi. According to our method, from a Rasi, the 1st, 5th, 7th, and 9th Rasis have the same nature. Furthermore, if you look at the 1st, 5th, 7th, and 9th Rasis from those Rasis, you will find the 3rd and 11th Rasis from the original spot. Therefore, the 3rd and 11th Rasis provide half-conjunction.
In Stellar Astrology (Nakshatra Jothidam), more importance is given to the Lords of the stars than the stars themselves. For example, whether a planet or Bhava is in Ashwini, Magam, or Moolam, since these three stars belong to Ketu, we say generally that the planet/bhava is in "Ketu Saram" (Star of Ketu).
Page 5: Rasis (Zodiac Signs)
These three star-paths will be in the 1st, 5th, and 9th houses at specific degrees. We use the same basis.
Furthermore, all planets do not rotate on the exact same flat plane in the cosmic plate. Every planet has its own path, moving up and down. When viewed from the side, since one is up and the other down, light waves pass the earth and reflect on the opposite side (the 7th Rasi). Therefore, 1, 5, 7, 9 and 3, 11 are considered equals. Thus, from the Rasi where a planet is seated, the 1, 5, 7, 9 and 3, 11 (50%) Rasis are considered "Connected Rasis" in our method.
The Rasis: "Rasi" means a group or cluster. When we view the universe from Earth, to identify the location of objects rotating in the universe, we need regions with specific boundaries. Since the universe is vast, expanded, and dark with no definable beginning or end, we identify objects based on the reflection of light from the star closest to us—the Sun.
To state where these identified objects are, we need divisions, so we have divided the total universal area and set boundaries. When viewed from Earth, this Zodiac belt (Rasi Mandalam) appears like a ring passing through East, Zenith (Overhead), West, and behind the Earth.
To understand this better, keep the path of the Sun in mind. The Sun rises in the East, travels to the Zenith, sets in the West, travels behind the Earth, and reaches the East again. All planets rotate in the same angular path that we view the Sun rotating in. But distances vary.
Even if distances vary, all planets deviate only slightly (North or South) from the Sun's path—maximum 7 degrees. They do not deviate entirely to the South or North. Since all planets rotate only in this path, this Rasi Chakra (Zodiac Wheel) helps us know planetary positions.
The Earth rotates around the Sun. The Moon rotates around the Earth. When viewing from Earth, as we see the Moon reflecting the Sun's light, the Moon's phases appear to change. Since the Moon's revolution period around the Earth is faster than the Earth's revolution around the Sun, the Moon moves fast, and its reflection status keeps changing.
We call these changes "Thithis." When the Moon comes between the Sun and Earth, the Sun's light falls on the side of the Moon opposite to our view, so we see the dark side of the Moon. We call this state Amavasya (New Moon). Since we cannot distinguish it in the darkness, it appears as if the Moon is not there.
Similarly, when the Earth is between the Sun and the Moon (Earth's backside), we see the full reflection of Sun's light on the Moon, making it appear fully bright. We call this Pournami (Full Moon). Within the time the Earth goes around the Sun once, 12 Amavasyas and Pournamis occur.
Page 6: The 12 Divisions
Therefore, we divided this total universe into 12 parts. When viewed from Earth, we compared the star clusters facing these specific divisions with shapes known to us and named them. Rasi is just a unit we separated for measurement. But within those separated measurements, we found the time-mathematics required for our life.
We divided the 360-degree circle surrounding us into 12 parts, allotting 30 degrees to each part, and named them Rasis. We call the total cluster the "Rasi Mandalam" (Zodiac Belt).
The 12 Rasis:
1.	Mesham (Aries): Ram's horns / Goat.
2.	Rishabam (Taurus): Bull.
3.	Mithunam (Gemini): A man with a mace and a woman with a Veena (Musical instrument).
4.	Kadagam (Cancer): Crab.
5.	Simham (Leo): Lion.
6.	Kanni (Virgo): A woman sitting in a boat with paddy sheaves.
7.	Thulam (Libra): Weighing Scale (Balance).
8.	Viruchigam (Scorpio): Scorpion.
9.	Dhanusu (Sagittarius): Horse-man holding a bow (Centaur).
10.	Makaram (Capricorn): An animal with a goat's head and fish's body.
11.	Kumbam (Aquarius): A dark man carrying an empty pot on his shoulder.
12.	Meenam (Pisces): Twin Fishes.
Rasi Lords: [Diagram of orbits] In the diagram, the paths are:
1.	Sun, 2. Mercury, 3. Venus, 4. Moon...
Page 7: Planetary Rulerships
5.	Mars, 6. Jupiter, 7. Saturn.
All planets, including Earth, rotate with the Sun as the center. As seen in the previous chapter, "Rasi Lords" essentially state the unification of the Geocentric and Heliocentric theories.
The intersection point where the imaginary path of other planets rotating around the Sun meets the imaginary path of the Sun rotating around us (Earth) points to a specific Rasi in the zodiac. That intersection point acquires the character of the Lord of that planetary path.
Observe the Diagram:
•	2 is the intersection point of Mercury's path. This indicates Gemini and Virgo Rasi areas.
•	3 is the intersection point of Venus's path. This indicates Taurus and Libra.
•	5 is the intersection point of Mars's path. This indicates Aries and Scorpio.
•	6 is the intersection point of Jupiter's path. This indicates Pisces and Sagittarius.
•	7 is the intersection point of Saturn's path. This indicates Aquarius and Capricorn.
•	1 indicates the Sun and Leo.
•	4 indicates the Amavasya Moon (12 degrees behind the Sun) and Cancer. (We will see later why Amavasya Moon is relevant).
This Zodiac belt creates an appearance as if viewed from Earth. Furthermore, the Zodiac belt is not horizontal from the Earth's equator but tilted; this is due to the Earth's tilt axis. Therefore, the vibrations coming from this Zodiac belt are not the same for all Rasis; they differ. Since their qualities align perfectly with the nature of their Lords, we can know the nature of the Rasis through the nature of the Lords.
However, there are things to understand about Rasi qualities beyond just planetary qualities. We can understand many qualities based on the symbols/images of each Rasi.
Generally, in astrology today, Rasi predictions are given based on the Rasi where the Moon is present. But we do not use Rasis that way. Instead, giving importance to planetary qualities, we connect planets with the Rasis they are in, identifying the relationships and objects that the planet indicates, and segregate them by quality.
[Table showing Rasi structure - corner signs are Pisces, Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius etc.]
Page 8: Application of Rasi Qualities
Therefore, whichever object or person a planet indicates, that object or person will possess the natural qualities of the Rasi that planet is in.
Do not look at the Rasi qualities given in the section below as you would for standard "Rasi Palan" (Horoscope reading). You must match them with the planet seated in that Rasi. Match it with the matter or relationship that the planet indicates.
Furthermore, match the Education, Profession, Place, Body Part, Disease, and Items listed for each Rasi with the planets present in that Rasi in the horoscope.
Example: If Saturn is in a Rasi, since Saturn indicates the native's profession, the native's profession will depend on the trade indicated by that Rasi. Similarly, if the Sun is in that Rasi, the native's father or son will possess the character, profession, education, and residence indicated by that Rasi.
You must tell these results to the Native's father or son. Similarly, when each planet is in a Rasi, the relationships indicated by that planet will exist with the nature of that Rasi. This alone does not determine the result; one must also come to a conclusion based on the planets conjoined with them and their various statuses. (We have provided details on Nadi and Planetary Conjunctions in the following section).
In the coming section, we will see the Karakas (Significations) of Rasis and Planets. This section is fundamental for you to predict results. The more Rasi and Planetary Karakas one knows, the more expert they are in astrology. Even more important is handling the known Karaka with presence of mind.
Example: A person comes for a consultation. In the bag he brought, a bottle was not closed properly, water leaked, and his shirt/dhoti got wet.
•	Instant deduction: Wet cloth indicates Mercury. So, you should think it is a matter related to Mercury's Karaka.
•	Similarly, if the native's name is "Premalatha" - Prem means Love. That is Moon. So, conclude the native is a Moon-related person.
•	Not just this, when predicting, one must handle many Karakas according to the situation.
In this section, I have given only a minimum amount of Karakas (those used frequently in general usage). So, without memorizing, read patiently and absorb them. Similarly, I have given the tree, plant, place, metal for each Rasi. Handle this according to the occasion.
Example: In a horoscope, Mercury is very important. You can immediately say there is a Park near his house. You can say someone is in a job related to Cement or Electricals. You can say the house entrance faces South. Similarly, Mercury's plant is Tulsi (Holy Basil). Tulsi is named Brindha. So, you can say help will come from a person named Brindha.
But you must use these by practicing and applying them according to the experience and environment.
Another Example: In a horoscope, Venus is in Aries. You can say near the house where the native's wife lives, there is a Mine, Tollgate, or Hospital. You must handle this with presence of mind.

Here is the comprehensive translation of the content from the file Chapter 2.pdf. The pages in the PDF were not in sequential order, so I have reorganized them into logical sections: Fundamental Rules, Planetary Significations (Karakas), Planets in Signs, and Planetary Conjunctions.
________________________________________
SECTION 1: FUNDAMENTAL RULES & METHODOLOGY
Degrees and Orbs (Printed Page 153)
•	The Rule of Orb: In our method, "conjunction" traditionally meant planets in the 1st, 5th, 7th, or 9th houses. However, for greater accuracy, we must consider the Degrees.
•	Influence Range: A planet dominates 15 degrees in front and 15 degrees behind its position.
•	Example: If a planet is at 22 degrees in Aries:
o	Backward limit: $22 - 15 = 7$ (Starts at Aries 7°).
o	Forward limit: $22 + 15 = 37$. Since Aries is only 30°, it extends 7° into Taurus.
o	Result: The planet influences from Aries 7° to Taurus 7°.
•	Trinal Connection: You must apply the same degree logic to the 5th, 7th, and 9th houses.
o	5th House connection: Leo 7° to Virgo 7°.
o	7th House connection: Libra 7° to Scorpio 7°.
•	Movement Direction: Once experienced, calculate 18 degrees in the direction the planet is moving (front) and 12 degrees behind it.
•	Note: Do not worry about Friend/Enemy, Exalted/Debilitated, Combustion, or Planetary War. These concepts are for determining strength in other systems. Here, we focus on the Nature/Quality of the planet.
Adhikara Graham (Authority Planet) (Printed Page 161-164)
This is a unique concept in Rajanadi. The "Authority Planet" decides the major events in a native's life.
•	How to Find the Authority Planet:
1.	A Planet in Retrograde (Vakram).
2.	A Planet in Exchange (Parivartana).
3.	A Planet at the Edge of a Rasi (First or last 2 degrees).
4.	Planets conjoined with the above.
5.	Planets in Own House or Exalted/Debilitated positions.
6.	Planets in the 1st, 5th, or 9th from Rahu/Ketu.
•	Effect: The Authority Planet dictates the native's identity. If Sun is the Authority Planet, the father will be a dominant figure, or the native will work in a government/authority role. Even if the father is absent, the "Sun" quality (authority/ego) will define the native's life struggles and successes.
Name Nadi (Using Names) (Printed Page 165-170)
•	You can predict a person's chart using their Name.
•	Example: Name "Lakshmi" = Venus (Sukra).
o	Read the results for Venus.
o	Her profession, family trade, and health will match Venus significations.
•	Example: Name "Muthurathinam".
o	Muthu (Pearl) = Moon. Rathinam (Gem) = Venus.
o	This indicates a Moon + Venus combination. Prediction: "Someone in the family is a Teacher or in the cloth trade."
•	Verification: If a client asks "When will I get a job?", and their Authority Planet is Sun, ask: "Did you have a toothache recently?" (Sun = Teeth). If yes, the planetary energy is active, and the event will happen soon.

•	Rule 21: Degrees and Orbs
o	Previously, we considered "conjunction" as planets simply being in the 1st, 5th, 7th, or 9th houses. To improve accuracy, we must look at Degrees.
o	Rule: A planet dominates 15 degrees in front and 15 degrees behind its position.
o	Example: If a planet is at 22 degrees in Aries:
	Backward limit: $22 - 15 = 7$ (Starts at Aries 7°).
	Forward limit: $22 + 15 = 37$. Since Aries has only 30 degrees, it extends 7 degrees into Taurus.
	Result: The planet connects with any planet situated between Aries 7° and Taurus 7°.
o	Trinal Connection: You must apply the same degree logic to the 5th, 7th, and 9th houses.
	If the planet is at Aries 22°, check Leo (5th house) from 7° to Virgo 7°, etc.
•	Advanced Movement Rule: Once experienced, calculate 18 degrees in the direction of movement (front) and 12 degrees behind.
o	Example: Saturn at 4° Aries. Front limit: $4+18 = 22$ (Aries 22°). Back limit: 12 degrees back (Pisces 22°). Saturn influences from Pisces 22° to Aries 22°.
•	Important Note: In this method, do not use traditional concepts like Friend/Enemy, Malefic/Benefic, Planetary War, Combustion, Yogi/Avayogi, or Maraka/Badhaka. These are for determining "strength" in other systems. Here, we focus on the Nature/Quality of the planet.

o	
12.	Check if the conjoined planet is Retro/Exchange/Edge.
o	
13.	Exchange: Treat the planet as if it is in its Own House. In Transit, when it enters its own house, predict birth chart results.

o	If Sun is Authority: Govt job possible, but constant friction with Govt. Relationship with Father is not smooth (scolded most by father), yet Father cares most. Even if Father dies, his aid remains (assets/job). Mother is similar.
o	The Authority Planet decides everything (Good and Bad).

•	Authority Signs (Adhikara Rasigal):
o	In astrology, Karakas (Significations) are very important. The basis of all astrology is understanding life.
o	In traditional astrology, they check how each House (Bhava) is. In all astrologies, they check planetary positions. Similarly, Rasis (Signs) also have Karakas.
o	Every astrology system states what each Rasi indicates. As we saw before, the qualities of the Rasis are roughly the Karakas of their Lords.
o	Similarly, if we look at the Houses (Lagana, 2nd house, etc.) keeping Aries as the first house, the qualities are that of the respective House Lords.
o	Concept: In Rajanadi method, if a planet sits in a specific Rasi, we call it an "Authority Planet" (Adhikara Graham). We say all its Karakas become important in the native's life. Similarly, based on the operating state of each Rasi, we can give predictions. We call this "Authority Rasi" (Adhikara Rasi).
o	How to find it: It is very simple. Whatever Rasi a planet sits in, that Rasi becomes an Authority.
o	Effect: Through the significations (Karaka) of that Authority Rasi, the native will face obstacles in the early stages but will attain goodness through it in later times.
o	Success: Clients often ask, "Will I be successful in anything?". You can say they will succeed in the significations of the Rasis where their planets are placed.
o	Multiple Planets: Even if one or more planets are in the same Rasi, that Rasi becomes Authority. In a horoscope, all Rasis containing planets become Authority.
o	Timing: The results should be stated keeping the native's age in mind.
o	Complications: Rasis containing Retrograde, Exchange, or Edge planets will create trouble in the beginning but do good later. Similarly, Rasis with Exalted, Debilitated, Own House planets, or planets in the 7th from their own house will give confusion initially and a feeling of satisfaction later.
o	Priority: Give priority to Rasis where Authority Planets (defined in Ch 2) are seated. However, any Rasi with a planet is also an Authority Rasi.
o	Struggle: The native will attain satisfaction in the signification of the Authority Rasi only after struggling.
•	If Aries (Mesham) becomes Authority:
o	Character: The native will become famous. Interested in Politics. Possesses Self-respect and Generosity. Ability to understand others' status. They will become an important person in the family.
o	Struggle: In the early stages, to maintain their status, they will cross various complications. Debt trouble, breach of trust, and facing small court cases may occur.
o	Health: Ailments in Head organs. Treatment for Heart and Head related problems.
o	Mindset: Mind and body built to control everyone. Harshness in words. When they face trouble, they will seek the help of the Law.

•	[Context: Continuation of Mercury or start of Sun?] Actually, looking at the content "Puberty... Father health... Court...", this matches the Sun Dasa description found in typical texts, but here it might be a continuation of Mercury or the start of Sun Dasa which is explicitly labeled on Page 9. However, Source 7197 discusses "Puberty... Father's health... Court... Theft...". This block seems to be the Sun Dasa section but the header is missing or it's the end of Mercury? Wait, let's look at Page 9. Page 9 has "Suryan Dasa" header at the bottom. This implies the text on Page 8 is likely Mercury Dasa continued or Ketu? No, "Father's health" and "Court" are Sun qualities. It is possible the pages are mixed up or this is a sub-section. Let's translate carefully.

•	Calculation of Bhukti Periods:
o	Example: Finding Venus Bhukti in Venus Dasa.
o	Venus Dasa Years = 20. Venus Bhukti is being found, so take 20.
o	Multiply: $20 \times 20 = 400$.
o	Take the last digit off (right side). Result: 40.0.
o	The 40 is Months. The decimal 0 is multiplied by 3 to get Days. (0 * 3 = 0).
o	Result: 40 Months.
o	Example: Saturn Bhukti in Rahu Dasa.
o	Rahu Years = 18. Saturn Years = 19.
o	$18 \times 19 = 342$.
o	Split: 34.2.
o	Months = 34.
o	Days = $2 \times 3 = 6$.
o	Result: 34 Months 6 Days.
•	Tables Provided:
o	Sun Dasa (6 Years): List of Bhuktis (Sun 3m 18d ... Venus 12m 0d).
o	Moon Dasa (10 Years): List of Bhuktis (Moon 10m ... Venus 20m).
o	Mars Dasa (7 Years): List of Bhuktis (Mars 4m 27d ... Venus 14m).

o	Saturn Dasa (19 Years): List of Bhuktis.
o	Ketu Dasa (7 Years): List of Bhuktis.
o	Venus Dasa (20 Years): List of Bhuktis.

•	Dasa Balance Calculation:
o	Example: Moon in Aries (Mesham) in Bharani Star.
o	Analogy: Moon lives in Tamil Nadu (Rasi), Madurai District (Star), Ward 3 (Pada).
o	Bharani belongs to Venus. Venus Dasa is 20 Years.
o	If Moon is at the start of Bharani, the native gets full 20 years.
o	If Moon is in 3rd Pada (crossed half), they get half (10 years).
o	This is "Dasa Balance" (Dasa Iruppu).
•	Dasa Lords and Years:
o	Sun (6 Years): Krittika, Uthiram, Uthiradam.
o	Moon (10 Years): Rohini, Hastam, Thiruvonam.
o	Mars (7 Years): Mrigasira, Chitra, Avittam.
o	Rahu (18 Years): Thiruvadirai, Swati, Sathayam.
o	Jupiter (16 Years): Punarpoosam, Visakam, Poorattathi.
o	Saturn (19 Years): Poosam, Anusham, Uthirattathi.
o	Mercury (17 Years): Ayilyam, Kettai, Revathi.
o	Ketu (7 Years): Ashwini, Magam, Moolam.
o	Venus (20 Years): Bharani, Pooram, Pooradam.
•	Sub-divisions: Each Dasa is divided into 9 Bhuktis. Bhukti is divided into Antharam. Antharam into Sookshmam.
•	Order: The first Bhukti is always the Dasa Lord's own Bhukti (Swa-Bhukti). Then follows the standard order of planets.
________________________________________
PDF Page 13 (Book Page 447, 448)
•	Order of Planets:
o	Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn are outside Earth's orbit. Mercury, Venus are inside.
o	The Dasa order cycles through the 9 planets 3 times across the 27 stars.
o	Order: Ketu -> Venus -> Sun -> Moon -> Mars -> Rahu -> Jupiter -> Saturn -> Mercury.
o	Example: Ashwini (Ketu) -> Bharani (Venus) -> Krittika (Sun)...
•	Diagrams:
o	The page contains diagrams showing the Zodiac wheel and Star placement.
•	Math:
o	1 Rasi = 30 Degrees.
o	1 Star = 13 Degrees 20 Minutes.
o	If Moon is at the start, full Dasa. If in middle, proportional Dasa.
________________________________________
PDF Page 14 (Book Page 445, 446)
•	Astronomical Basis of Dasa:
o	Moon's path is tilted 5 degrees from the Earth-Sun plane.
o	It moves up 5 degrees and down 5 degrees (Total 10 deg deviation one way, 20 deg full swing?).
o	The nodal cycle (Rahu/Ketu) takes roughly 18.5 years.
o	The calculation of 120 years Dasa system is derived from Moon's lateral movement degrees (360 degrees = 360 years? No, 120 degrees lateral movement = 120 years). The text attempts to explain the astronomical logic of 120 years but says it will be detailed in another book.
•	Speed & Karaka:
o	Fastest planet: Moon. Fastest change in us: Mind. So Moon = Mind.
o	Next speed: Mercury. Next change: Intellect. So Mercury = Intellect.
o	Venus = Desire. Sun = Knowledge. Mars = Body. Jupiter = Soul (Ullam). Saturn = Livelihood/Karma.
•	Dasa Philosophy:
o	Dasa is like the growing evolution of results for the native.
o	Zodiac is divided into 12 Rasis and 27 Stars.
o	27 comes from Moon taking 27.3 days to orbit Earth.
o	Horoscope is the map of planets at birth.
o	Janma Rasi = Moon's Sign. Janma Nakshatra = Moon's Star.
o	Each Star has a Lord. 27 stars / 9 planets = 3 stars per planet.

•	Types of Dasa Systems:
o	Ashtottari, Shodashottari, Dwadasottari, Vimshottari (120), Panchottari, etc. (List of many Dasa systems like Kalachakra, Yogini).
o	Most astrologers don't know the math for all these.
o	Currently, Vimshottari (120 years) is the most used.
o	It is used because it's easy to calculate and based on Moon's position.
•	Our Method:
o	We can also give predictions using Authority Results without using Dasa/Lagana.
o	But first, understanding Dasa basics is good.
•	Why Moon is Key:
o	Astrology gives importance to Moon because Rasi/Star measurements are centered on it.
o	Moon's orbit is the reference for the "Zodiac belt".
o	The Moon's path wobbles (nodes), taking 18.5 years to reset. This is the basis of Rahu/Ketu.

•	Business Advice:
o	Do any business with neatness, involvement, and attention. Don't focus only on money. Keep a good name. Adapt to modern times. Self-satisfaction brings success and fame.
•	Mahadasa Results based on Authority Planet:
o	Rajanadi doesn't strictly rely on Dasa Bhukti.
o	However, since clients ask based on other astrologers' input, knowing it helps.
o	Standard astrology uses House lordships, Aspects, Stars, etc. for Dasa results. We don't need that.
o	Our Logic: We use Rajanadi Rules (Authority Planets).
o	Why? Standard Dasa predictions (like "Education in education age") happen anyway. Bad Dasa at young age still allows growth. So generic age-based results happen regardless.
o	But Authority Planet based Dasa results help identify the specific flavor of events in that period.
o	Tajikam: Uses Gochar (Transit) for timing.
o	We use Dasa as a broad timer.

•	Ethics for Astrologers:
o	Do not strike out or correct the horoscope notebook brought by the client.
o	Take notes on a separate sheet.
o	Dhruva (Siblings Count): Do not predict number of siblings (Dhruva) to impress the client. If they ask why you didn't say it, explain you focus on their life. Don't trick people.
o	Atmosphere: The office should be comforting, not scary (like a magician's den). Be like a relative to the client.
o	Humility: We are just consultants analyzing probability using math. Don't act like God or claim to change Fate.
o	Warning: Astrologers who prescribe many remedies often have tragic family lives (Divorce, dull children, unnatural deaths). Their mind is filled with negative words (Dosha, Curse, Death). This negativity manifests in their own lives.
o	Positive Approach: Use the chart to encourage the client. Point out possibilities for growth. If a bad time is seen, advise caution and minimizing damage, but don't claim to wipe it away. Fate cannot be changed completely.

•	Prediction Flow:
o	
1.	Check Planetary positions (Conjunctions, Rahu/Ketu links, Retro, Exchange).
o	
2.	Confirm with past 2 years' events.
o	
3.	Predict current situation.
o	
4.	Predict next 2 years (The main reason they came).
o	Interaction:
	Give them a chance to ask questions. Don't keep talking yourself.
	Listen to them fully.
	Distractions: If accompanying people (elderly women, half-knowledgeable people) interrupt with useless questions, politely silence them or ask to speak to the native alone. They ruin the purpose.
	Patience: If the client doesn't understand, explain again without anger.
	Analysis: Don't rush. Take time to analyze the chart before speaking. If needed, write notes first to avoid awkward silence (staring at the chart scares the client). Writing gives the impression of calculation.

o	Focus: Speak about Good results for hours and Bad results in seconds (briefly).
o	Time: 10 minutes prediction is enough. Use rest of time to explain/clarify.
o	Written Note: Provide a one-page summary in a good white envelope with your address stamped. This serves as a record and marketing.
